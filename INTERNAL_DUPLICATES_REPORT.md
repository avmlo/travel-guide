## Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Fix Exact Duplicate (Required)

**The Mark (New York)** - IDs 1676 and 1677
```sql
-- Option A: Delete the duplicate (after verifying no unique data)
DELETE FROM destinations WHERE id = 1677;

-- Option B: Merge data first, then delete
-- 1. Manually check if ID 1677 has any unique data (images, descriptions, etc.)
-- 2. If yes, update ID 1676 with that data
-- 3. Then delete ID 1677
```

### Priority 2: Review High-Confidence Duplicates (Recommended)

1. **Park Hyatt Milan/Milano** - Merge (same hotel)
2. **Hotel Higashiyama variations** - Merge (same hotel)
3. **Palace Hotel Tokyo / Pace Tokyo** - Investigate first

### Priority 3: Review Medium-Confidence Matches (Optional)

Focus on these 5:
1. Samaritaine vs La Samaritaine
2. Faena Hotel vs Casa Faena
3. Experimental Marais variations
4. Hotel Toranomon Hills vs Toranomon Hills
5. Blue Bottle Coffee Kobe variations

## How to Merge Duplicates

### Step 1: Identify the "Keep" Record
Choose which record to keep based on:
- Better slug (shorter, cleaner)
- More complete data (more fields filled)
- Better images

### Step 2: Merge Unique Data
```sql
-- Example: Merge The Mark hotels
-- First, check what data each has
SELECT * FROM destinations WHERE id IN (1676, 1677);

-- If ID 1677 has unique data (e.g., better images), update ID 1676
UPDATE destinations 
SET 
  image = 'better_image_url',
  gallery = array_cat(gallery, (SELECT gallery FROM destinations WHERE id = 1677))
WHERE id = 1676;
```

### Step 3: Update References
```sql
-- Update any foreign key references (if any)
UPDATE saved_destinations SET destination_id = 1676 WHERE destination_id = 1677;
UPDATE list_destinations SET destination_id = 1676 WHERE destination_id = 1677;
```

### Step 4: Delete Duplicate
```sql
DELETE FROM destinations WHERE id = 1677;
```

---

## Prevention Strategy

To prevent future duplicates:

1. **Add a unique constraint** on (name, city):
```sql
-- This will prevent exact duplicate names in the same city
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_destinations_name_city ON destinations(LOWER(name), city);
```

2. **Implement fuzzy matching** in your admin interface when adding new destinations

3. **Regular audits** - Run this duplicate detection script quarterly
