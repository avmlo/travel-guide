## Merge Strategy

The script used intelligent merging logic:

1. **Text fields:** Kept the longer, more detailed version
2. **Null fields:** Filled in missing data from the duplicate
3. **Arrays (gallery):** Combined and deduplicated images
4. **Numbers:** Preferred non-zero values
5. **Default:** When in doubt, kept the original "keep" entry value

## Database Statistics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
None required - all merges are complete and verified!

### Optional Future Actions

1. **Review remaining medium-confidence matches** - We identified 21 potential duplicates that might need review:
   - Blue Bottle Coffee locations (likely different branches - keep separate)
   - Faena Hotel vs Casa Faena (might be different properties)
   - Hotel Toranomon Hills vs Toranomon Hills (might be hotel vs building)

2. **Prevent future duplicates** - Consider adding a unique constraint:
   ```sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_destinations_name_city 
   ON destinations(LOWER(name), city);
   ```

3. **Regular audits** - Run the duplicate detection script quarterly to catch new duplicates early
