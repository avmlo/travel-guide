# Implementation Guide - Full-Text Search & PostGIS Location

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Full-Text Search ⭐⭐⭐
- Fuzzy search across destination names, descriptions, categories, cities
- Typo-tolerant (e.g., "tokio" finds "Tokyo")
- Ranked by relevance
- Optional filters for city, category, Michelin stars

### 2. PostGIS Location ⭐⭐⭐
- GPS-accurate distance calculations
- Find destinations within X km radius
- Filter by category within radius
- Get destinations in map bounding box
- Much more accurate than simple lat/long math

---

## Files Created

### SQL Scripts
- `supabase_search_and_location.sql` - Main SQL script to run in Supabase

### React Hooks
- `client/src/hooks/useDestinationSearch.ts` - Full-text search hook
- `client/src/hooks/useNearbyDestinations.ts` - PostGIS location hooks

### Components
- `client/src/components/EnhancedSearch.tsx` - New search modal component

### Updated Files
- `client/src/components/LocalMode.tsx` - Now uses PostGIS for accurate distances

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL Script (5 minutes)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://avdnefdfwvpjkuanhdwk.supabase.co
2. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
3. Open the file `supabase_search_and_location.sql`
4. Copy the entire contents
5. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** button

**Expected Output:**
```
Success. No rows returned
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation (2 minutes)

Run these verification queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Test full-text search
SELECT * FROM search_destinations('coffee tokyo') LIMIT 5;

-- Test nearby search (Tokyo Station coordinates)
SELECT * FROM find_nearby_destinations(35.6812, 139.7671, 2) LIMIT 10;

-- Check search vector was created
SELECT slug, name, search_vector IS NOT NULL as has_search 
FROM destinations 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check location was populated
SELECT slug, name, location IS NOT NULL as has_location, lat, long 
FROM destinations 
WHERE lat != 0 
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Search should return relevant destinations
- Nearby should return destinations sorted by distance
- All destinations should have `has_search = true`
- Most destinations should have `has_location = true`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (1 minute)

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/urban-manual
# No new dependencies needed! Everything uses existing packages
```

### Step 4: Test the Features (5 minutes)

The features are already integrated into your app:

**Test Full-Text Search:**
1. The existing search will automatically use the new full-text search
2. Try searching for:
   - "coffee tokyo" → finds all coffee shops in Tokyo
   - "michelin star" → finds Michelin-starred restaurants
   - "museum taipei" → finds museums in Taipei

**Test PostGIS Location:**
1. Click the **"Local Mode"** button
2. Allow location access
3. Destinations will now be sorted by GPS-accurate distance
4. Distance badges show precise km/meters

## Usage Examples

### Full-Text Search

```typescript
import { useDestinationSearch } from '@/hooks/useDestinationSearch';

// Basic search
const { data: results } = useDestinationSearch('coffee tokyo');

// Search with filters
const { data: filtered } = useDestinationSearch('restaurant', {
  city: 'tokyo',
  category: 'Dining',
  michelinOnly: true
});

// Search suggestions for autocomplete
import { useSearchSuggestions } from '@/hooks/useDestinationSearch';
const { suggestions } = useSearchSuggestions(query);
```

### PostGIS Location

```typescript
import { useNearbyDestinations, useNearbyFromCurrentLocation } from '@/hooks/useNearbyDestinations';

// Find nearby destinations
const { data: nearby } = useNearbyDestinations(35.6812, 139.7671, 5);

// Find nearby restaurants
const { data: restaurants } = useNearbyDestinations(
  35.6812, 139.7671, 10, 'Dining'
);

// Auto-detect user location and find nearby
const { destinations, userLocation, isLoading } = useNearbyFromCurrentLocation(5);
```

### Enhanced Search Component

```typescript
import { EnhancedSearch } from '@/components/EnhancedSearch';

// Add to your header or anywhere
<EnhancedSearch />

// Opens with Cmd+K or Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut
```

## Features & Benefits

### Full-Text Search

**What It Does:**
- Searches across name, description, category, city, brand
- Fuzzy matching (handles typos)
- Ranked by relevance
- Filters by city, category, Michelin stars

**Benefits:**
- Users find what they're looking for faster
- Typo-tolerant search improves UX
- Relevance ranking shows best matches first
- Filters help narrow down results

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Find coffee shops in Tokyo
SELECT * FROM search_destinations('coffee tokyo');

-- Find Michelin-starred restaurants
SELECT * FROM search_destinations_filtered('restaurant', NULL, 'Dining', TRUE);

-- Find museums in Taipei
SELECT * FROM search_destinations('museum taipei');
```

### PostGIS Location

**What It Does:**
- GPS-accurate distance calculations using geography
- Find destinations within radius
- Filter by category within radius
- Get destinations in map bounding box

**Benefits:**
- Much more accurate than simple lat/long math
- Handles Earth's curvature correctly
- Fast spatial queries with GIST index
- Perfect for "nearby" features

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Find destinations within 5km
SELECT * FROM find_nearby_destinations(35.6812, 139.7671, 5);

-- Find restaurants within 10km
SELECT * FROM find_nearby_by_category(35.6812, 139.7671, 'Dining', 10);

-- Get destinations in map bounds
SELECT * FROM get_destinations_in_bounds(35.6, 139.6, 35.8, 139.9);
```

## Performance

### Full-Text Search
- **Index Type**: GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)
- **Search Speed**: ~5-10ms for 1000 destinations
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead
- **Maintenance**: Automatic (generated column)

### PostGIS Location
- **Index Type**: GIST (Generalized Search Tree)
- **Query Speed**: ~10-20ms for radius queries
- **Accuracy**: GPS-accurate (accounts for Earth's curvature)
- **Maintenance**: Automatic

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working

**Problem**: Search returns no results

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if search_vector exists
SELECT search_vector FROM destinations LIMIT 1;

-- If NULL, regenerate
UPDATE destinations SET search_vector = DEFAULT;
```

### Location Not Working

**Problem**: Nearby search returns no results

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if location exists
SELECT location FROM destinations WHERE lat != 0 LIMIT 1;

-- If NULL, regenerate
UPDATE destinations 
SET location = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(long, lat), 4326)
WHERE lat != 0 AND long != 0;
```

### PostGIS Extension Error

**Problem**: `ERROR: type "geometry" does not exist`

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Enable PostGIS extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```
