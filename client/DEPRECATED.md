The project has been migrated to Next.js 16 with the following improvements:
- ✅ Server-side rendering (SSR)
- ✅ App Router architecture
- ✅ Improved performance with Turbopack
- ✅ Direct Supabase integration (no tRPC complexity)
- ✅ Unified navigation across all pages
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Google OAuth authentication

## Running the Next.js App

```bash
cd ../urban-manual-next
npm install
npm run dev
```
