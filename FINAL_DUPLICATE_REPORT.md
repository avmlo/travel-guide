## ðŸ”´ Critical Duplicate (100% Match) - **1 Found**

This is the only duplicate that needs to be fixed. The name is identical, but the slug and category are different.

### 1. **Hotel Toranomon Hills** (Tokyo)
- **Entry 1 (Keep):** ID `1254`, Slug: `hotel-toranomon-hills`, Category: `Hotel`
- **Entry 2 (Delete):** ID `931`, Slug: `toranomon-hills`, Category: `Others`

**Analysis:** These are the same entity. Entry 1 is more accurate, with a better slug and the correct category. Entry 2 is less specific.

**Recommendation:** **Merge these immediately.**
1. Keep Entry 1 (ID 1254).
2. Merge any unique data from Entry 2 (ID 931) into Entry 1.
3. Delete Entry 2.

## ðŸŸ¢ Medium-Confidence Analysis (80-89%) - **19 Found**

These are **NOT critical duplicates** and likely do not need to be merged. They are correctly identified as related but distinct entities.

### Why they are NOT duplicates:

#### 1. Different Branches of the Same Chain
- **Example:** `Blue Bottle Coffee Samseong Cafe` vs `Blue Bottle Coffee Myeongdong Cafe` (Seoul)
- **Analysis:** These are two different coffee shop locations. They should remain separate entries.

#### 2. Different Hotels from the Same Brand
- **Example:** `Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi` vs `Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Otemachi` (Tokyo)
- **Analysis:** These are two distinct Four Seasons properties in Tokyo. They must remain separate.

#### 3. Venue vs. Sub-Venue
- **Example:** `The Connaught` vs `The Connaught Bar` (London)
- **Analysis:** One is the hotel, one is the bar inside the hotel. While related, they are often treated as separate destinations. You may want to keep both, or link them relationally in the future.

**Recommendation:** **No action needed** for the medium-confidence matches at this time. They are correctly flagged as similar but are not true duplicates that need merging.
