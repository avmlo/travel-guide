## 3. Detailed API Analysis & Use Cases

The 16 APIs can be grouped into four functional categories: **Mapping**, **Routing**, **Places & Location**, and **AI & Services**.

### 3.1. Mapping APIs

This group of APIs is focused on displaying visual maps.

| API Name | Description | Use Case for Urban Manual | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maps JavaScript API** | The flagship API for creating fully interactive and customizable maps in the browser. | The foundational mapping experience. Display all destinations, user location, and custom routes. | Interactive |
| **Maps Embed API** | A simple way to place a Google Map on a page with a single HTTP request. Limited customization. | Quickly embed a simple, non-interactive map on a destination detail page. | Embedded |
| **Maps Static API** | Generates a static map image based on URL parameters. No interactivity. | Generate map images for emails (e.g., trip summaries) or for very lightweight page elements. | Static Image |

> **Recommendation:** Use the **Maps JavaScript API** as the primary tool for all interactive map features. Use the **Maps Static API** for email and other non-interactive contexts.

### 3.2. Routing & Directions APIs

These APIs calculate travel paths and times.

| API Name | Description | Use Case for Urban Manual | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Routes API** | The next-generation routing engine. Provides real-time traffic, multi-modal routes, and advanced features like eco-friendly routing. | **Itinerary Planning:** Calculate the most efficient path for a user's custom list of destinations, including walking times and transit options. | Data |
| **Directions API** | The legacy API for turn-by-turn directions. Still functional but superseded by the Routes API. | (Legacy) Use for basic A-to-B directions if advanced features are not needed. | Data |
| **Distance Matrix API** | Calculates travel time and distance between multiple origins and destinations. | **Proximity Sorting:** Quickly calculate and sort destinations by travel time from the user's current location or hotel. | Data |
| **Roads API** | Snaps GPS coordinates to the nearest road, creating a clean path. | **Trip Tracker:** If you build a feature to record a user's journey, this API can clean up the GPS data to show a smooth travel path. | Data |

> **Recommendation:** Prioritize the **Routes API** for all new itinerary and direction features. Use the **Distance Matrix API** for sorting and filtering by travel time.

### 3.3. Places & Location APIs

These APIs provide rich information about real-world locations.

| API Name | Description | Use Case for Urban Manual | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Places API (New)** | The modern, preferred API for finding places and getting rich details like photos, reviews, hours, and accessibility info. | **Destination Enrichment:** This is critical. Use it to automatically pull the latest photos, user reviews, opening hours, and price level for every destination in your database. | Data |
| **Places API (Legacy)** | The older version of the Places API. Still functional but will be deprecated. | (Legacy) Should be avoided in favor of the new version. | Data |
| **Geocoding API** | Converts addresses into geographic coordinates (and vice versa). | **Data Integrity:** Onboard new destinations by converting their addresses into precise lat/lng coordinates for accurate map placement. | Data |
| **Geolocation API** | Determines a user's location based on cell towers and Wi-Fi signals, without needing GPS. | **"Nearby" Feature:** Find the user's approximate location to suggest nearby destinations, even if they deny GPS access. | Data |
| **Time Zone API** | Provides the time zone for a given latitude and longitude. | **Local Time Display:** Show the current local time for any destination a user is viewing. | Data |

> **Recommendation:** The **Places API (New)** is the single most valuable API for enhancing your content. **Geocoding** is essential for backend data management.

### 3.4. AI & Service Management APIs

These APIs provide generative AI capabilities and operational management.

| API Name | Description | Use Case for Urban Manual | Type |
