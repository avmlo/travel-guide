## üöÄ Building the iOS App

### Step 1: Build the Web App
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/travel-guide
npm run build
```

This creates the production build in `dist/public/`.

### Step 2: Sync with iOS Project
```bash
npx cap sync ios
```

This copies your web assets to the iOS project and updates native dependencies.

### Step 3: Open in Xcode
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

This opens the iOS project in Xcode.

---

## üì± Testing on iOS

### Option 1: iOS Simulator
1. Open Xcode
2. Select a simulator device (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro)
3. Click the **Play** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) or press `Cmd + R`
4. The app will launch in the simulator

### Option 2: Physical Device
1. Connect your iPhone via USB
2. Trust the computer on your iPhone
3. In Xcode, select your device from the device menu
4. Click **Play** to build and run

**Note**: For physical devices, you need to configure code signing (see below).

## üîê Code Signing & Provisioning

### Automatic Signing (Recommended for Testing)
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the **App** target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Check **Automatically manage signing**
5. Select your **Team** (Apple Developer account)
6. Xcode will create a provisioning profile automatically

### Manual Signing (For Production)
1. Create an **App ID** in Apple Developer Portal
   - Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers
   - Click **+** to create new identifier
   - Select **App IDs** ‚Üí **App**
   - Bundle ID: `com.travelguide.app`
   - Description: Travel Guide

   - Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles
   - Click **+** to create new profile
   - Select **iOS App Development** or **App Store**
   - Select your App ID and certificates
   - Download and double-click to install

3. In Xcode:
   - Uncheck **Automatically manage signing**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "CocoaPods not installed"
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```

### Issue: "Code signing error"
- Ensure you're logged into Xcode with your Apple ID
- Go to Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
- Add your Apple Developer account

### Issue: "No provisioning profiles found"
- Enable **Automatically manage signing** in Xcode
- Or create profiles manually in Apple Developer Portal

### Issue: "Build failed - module not found"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd ios/App
pod install
cd ../..
npx cap sync ios
```

### Issue: "App crashes on launch"
- Check Console.app for crash logs
- Verify all Capacitor plugins are properly installed
- Test in Safari Web Inspector (for web view debugging)

### Issue: "White screen on app launch"
