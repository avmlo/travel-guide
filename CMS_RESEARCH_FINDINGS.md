## Additional Finding: Payload CMS

### 6. Payload CMS (Open Source)
- **Best For**: Next.js native, TypeScript-first, code-based configuration
- **Pricing**: Free (self-hosted) → Cloud pricing TBA
- **Pros**: 
  - Built specifically for Next.js (not just compatible)
  - 7x faster than Strapi (according to their benchmarks)
  - Code-first architecture (no GUI config needed)
  - Native TypeScript support
  - **Direct Supabase/PostgreSQL support**
  - True visual editing (click and edit on page)
  - Supports React Server Components
  - Turbopack support out of box
- **Cons**: 
  - Newer than competitors (smaller community)
  - Self-hosted setup required
  - Less mature ecosystem
- **TypeScript**: ✅ Excellent - TypeScript-first
- **Integration**: ✅ **Native PostgreSQL adapter - works directly with Supabase**

### Key Differentiators
- **Next.js Native**: Unlike other CMS options that "support" Next.js, Payload is built ON Next.js
- **Code-First**: Configuration is done in TypeScript files, not GUI (better for version control)
- **PostgreSQL Native**: Can use Supabase database directly without API layer
- **Performance**: Claims 7x faster than Strapi in benchmarks
- **Modern Stack**: Supports React Server Components, Turbopack, serverless deployment

### Payload + Supabase Integration
According to Payload's documentation, they have a specific guide for integrating with Supabase:
- Uses PostgreSQL adapter
- Can connect directly to Supabase database
- No need for separate database - can use existing Supabase instance
- Maintains type safety throughout

## Updated Recommendation Priority

For Urban Manual's specific setup (Next.js 16 + Supabase + TypeScript):

1. **Payload CMS** - Best fit due to Next.js native architecture and direct Supabase support
2. **Strapi** - Strong second choice, mature, self-hosted, PostgreSQL support
3. **Sanity** - Best for managed solution with real-time collaboration
4. **Contentful** - Mature platform but more expensive
5. **Storyblok** - Good for visual editing needs
