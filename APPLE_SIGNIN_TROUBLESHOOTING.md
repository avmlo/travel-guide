# Fixing "No App ID is available" Error - Apple Sign In

**Issue:** When trying to configure Services ID for Sign in with Apple, you see "No App ID is available" in the dropdown.

---

## Quick Fix (Most Common)

### **The Problem:**
You need to **configure the App ID first** before it appears in the Services ID dropdown.

### **The Solution:**

#### **Step 1: Go Back to Your App ID**

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
2. Click on your **App ID** (e.g., `com.urbanmanual.app`)
3. Scroll down to **"Sign in with Apple"**
4. Click **"Edit"** or **"Configure"** next to it

#### **Step 2: Configure Sign in with Apple on the App ID**

```
Sign in with Apple:
‚úÖ Enabled

Click: Configure

- Group with existing primary App ID: (Leave unchecked unless you have multiple apps)

Click: Save
Click: Continue
Click: Save (on the main App ID page)
```

#### **Step 3: Wait 5-10 Minutes**

Apple's system needs time to propagate the changes. This is important!

‚òï Grab a coffee
üîÑ Refresh the page
```

#### **Step 4: Now Configure Services ID**

1. Go back to **Services IDs**

## Step-by-Step: Correct Order

Here's the **exact order** to avoid this issue:

Click: Save
Click: Continue
Click: Save
```

### **3. Wait (5-10 min)**
